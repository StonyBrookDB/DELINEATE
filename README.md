# DELINEATE
Deep Learning Based Steatosis Segmentation

## Introduction
CNN based model for delineating the boundaries of overlapped Steatosis droplets in whole-slide liver histopathology images. This project has three phases, first dil-Unet is used for steatosis region prediction and HNN model is used for boundary detection followed by the third model FCN-8s is used for integrating region and boundary information to generate the final prediction result.
